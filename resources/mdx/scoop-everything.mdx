# Scoop Everything

I recently completely nuked my system because it was slow, I've lost track of what was installed on my PC. The more I've used scoop (or any command line installer for that matter) the more I've loved it.

No more having to keep track of your updates, just `scoop update *` every morning and you're good to go.

Previously I've used scoop to manage my developer environment, but I've let this bleed over into my personal applications.

Only 1 exception, I have a few apps auto update (Firefox, Discord, Steam), leave those alone, they do the job for you. But everything else, add it via scoop.

Here's everything I have so far:
